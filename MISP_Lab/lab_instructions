**Add the COVID-19 feed**

add the Microsoft feed to the MISP server. There is good documentation for this but in brief click ‘Sync Actions’ on the main menu then ‘List feeds’ and click ‘Add Feed’. The address of Microsoft’s COVID-19 feed can be found above. Enter this in the URL textbox. Next you will need to select ‘Simple CSV Parsed Feed’ from the list box. Most of the text boxes can be left blank but you must set the ‘Value field(s) in the CSV’ to 2. Set the other properties to reasonable values and click Add. Make sure you have ticked the ‘Enable’ checkbox.

There are several other 3rd party feeds you may also want to enable and have available in your Sentinel workspace. Each of these will need to be enabled separately.
